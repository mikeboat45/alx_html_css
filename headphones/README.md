# Headphone Website Project
This project is a fully responsive web page built from scratch using only HTML5 and CSS3. The goal was to replicate a provided design, focusing on creating a pixel-perfect, accessible, and mobile-friendly experience without the use of any external libraries or frameworks.

## Features
- Responsive Design: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to tablets and desktops, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for all users.

- Semantic HTML: The page is structured with modern, semantic HTML5 tags (```<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>```) to improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

- CSS Flexbox & Grid: Utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid for efficient and flexible layout management, particularly for the multi-column sections.

- CSS clip-path: The unique pentagon shapes in the "Our results speak for themselves" section were created using the CSS clip-path property, demonstrating a creative approach to complex shapes.

- Minimalist Design: The clean and modern design is achieved with a well-defined color palette and elegant fonts.

- Accessible: The project includes considerations for accessibility, ensuring a positive experience for users with disabilities.
